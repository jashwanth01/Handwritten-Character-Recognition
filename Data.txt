For recognising handwritten forms, the very first step was to gather data in a considerable amount for training.

The dataset contains 26 folders (A-Z) containing handwritten images in size 28*28 pixels, each alphabet in the image is centre fitted to 20*20 pixel box.
Each image is stored as Gray-level
Kernel CSVToImages contains script to convert .CSV file to actual images in .png format in structured folder.

Note: Might contain some noisy image as well

The images aretaken from NIST(https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19) and
NMIST large dataset and few other sources which were then formatted as mentioned above.
